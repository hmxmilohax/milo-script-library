# This config file works as follows:
#
# Comments begin with '#' or '//' and may appear anywhere
#
# Statements may be any of the following:
#
# HOST_ONLY         - don't look on CD-ROM for files
# CD_HOST           - look on CD first, then on HOST (turns on ARKFILES)
# CD_ONLY           - look on CD only, even if on devstation
# MEMLOG [logfile]  - perform memory logging, to "memlogps.txt" or spec. file
# FILELOG [logfile] - perform file i/o logging, to "filiolog.txt" or spec. file
# ARKFILES          - use ARK files
# NOARKFILES        - don't use ARK files (default, unless CD_ONLY)
# TRACEON           - Turn on Trace printing (default for now)
# TRACEOFF          - No Trace printing
# BLUETRACEON       - if trace printing is on, print to blue screen on ps2 also
# BLUETRACEOFF      - if trace printing is on, only print to console on host machine
# DEBUGPAD          - Make controller 2's L2 act as ctrl key for debug cmds
# LEVELERR          - write levname.err files out on ps2 level loads
# REPORTMEM         - Report RND memory usage (and possibly other memory reporting)
# CUTSCENE [ON|OFF] - Turn intro cutscene on or off
#
# This file is always read, though some items are ignored if the
# file 'hosthere.txt' is absent (meaning that we're CD_ONLY on a real
# PS2).  The ignored items in the case of a real PS2 run are:
# HOST_ONLY, CD_HOST, MEMLOG, FILELOG, and NOARKFILES.
