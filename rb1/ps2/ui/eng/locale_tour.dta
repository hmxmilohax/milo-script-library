(tour_band_canwin_tour_vehicle_van "Wanna get outta your hometown and finally get on the road? Well, this is your chance to WIN A VAN! It ain't pretty, but it WILL get you on the road!")
(tour_band_canwin_tour_vehicle_bus "The van is holding together (with duct tape and chicken wire) but it sure ain't glamorous. This is your chance to WIN A BUS to tour the continent and travel in style!")
(tour_band_canwin_tour_staff_roadies "OH NO! The evil and corrupt band DETHFACTORY has challenged you to a Rock-Off! If you beat them, you'll gain serious street cred... \nAND STEAL THEIR ROADIES!")
(tour_band_canwin_tour_vehicle_jet "Sure, riding around in a bus is nice... but you know what's nicer? A FREAKIN' JET. Impress the bigwigs at this showcase and you'll score a JET that you can use to tour the globe!!")
(tour_band_canwin_tour_staff_promoter "Everybody has an off-night, even you! When that happens, it sure would be nice to pass the blame... and that's what the SOUND GUY is for! Play well at this gig and you'll end up with an audio pro who can handle your sound AND your reputation!")
(tour_band_canwin_tour_staff_security "Lately your fans have been a bit... boisterous. You need major muscle to protect you from the throngs trying to lick your sweat off the flash pots. Play well at this show and you'll score BODYGUARDS so you can play monster shows!!")
(tour_band_canwin_tour_staff_tourmanager "That thing that you put on the rider at the last show leaked to the press... you REALLY need a PR FIRM. Play well at this show and you'll score your very own PR FIRM to spin every minor misstep into solid gold.")
(tour_band_canwin_tour_halloffame_complete "Only the greatest musicians in the world are invited to compete for a 'Hall of Fame' award. It takes skill, dedication, and maybe even some liquid courage to finish this set. Are you ready to solidify your place in Rock 'N' Roll history?")
(tour_band_canwin_tour_bwt_complete "The Endless Setlist. It's a legend that's never been verified - until now. If you're prepared to deliver 58 songs in a row, then take the trip to Moscow to prove to the world that your band is untouchable.")

;; this one shows up when you win the gig. It should tell you about what you just won, as well as provide a narrative carrot to the next item
(tour_hint_new_tour_vehicle_van "NICE, you scored a VAN!! Vrrrooom! The bigger vehicles you get, the more cities you can play!\n\nYou might even become big enough to earn a TOUR BUS so that you can tour the continent and stop worrying about those huge plumes of black smoke coming out of your van's transmission...")
(tour_hint_new_tour_vehicle_bus "The whole continent is yours to tour now that you have a TOUR BUS! Try to work on your music in there, don't just sit around all day playing Skate or Die!<sup>TM</sup>\n\nWith all this gear to schlep, you may need some extra muscle soon. Keep an eye out for capable ROADIES!")
(tour_hint_new_tour_staff_roadies "Obviously you're really too talented to lug your own gear, and now that you have this skilled crew to haul your stuff, you can play HUGE ARENAS! \n\nGaining staff members opens up new venues for you to play in!")
(tour_hint_new_tour_vehicle_jet "You scored a JET! Hey, you know what is totally awesome? Having your own JET! Now that you've got wheels AND wings, it's time to hire somebody to make sure you sound stellar in even the biggest arenas. Keep an eye out for a SOUND GUY who can maintain your signature sound at huge shows.")
(tour_hint_new_tour_staff_promoter "Sweet, a SOUND GUY has joined your entourage! \nNow you've got a professional handling your sound, so you'll always have somebody to lay the blame on. \n\nAt this level of success, you might find yourself needing BODYGUARDS soon...")
(tour_hint_new_tour_staff_security "BODYGUARDS have joined your crew! \nYou can finally stop worrying about crazed fans hiding in birthday cakes! Plus it always looks cool in pictures to be flanked by really giant dudes with crew cuts. \n\nSpeaking of pictures, maybe it's time to hire a PR FIRM? After that last hotel incident, you need some pros around to put a positive spin on your behavior...")
(tour_hint_new_tour_staff_tourmanager "A PR FIRM has joined your crew! \nIt may not sound glamorous, but you'll be glad you've got 'em around once those photos of you in Vegas turn up... not to mention the \qshark incident.\q \n\nOf course it's just that sort of behavior that can lead to a 'Hall of Fame' award, but only the best are even invited...")
(tour_hint_new_tour_halloffame_complete "You have joined the Hall of Fame!! Congratulations on becoming a true part of Rock 'N' Roll history. You've come a long way... and you'll be remembered forever. Oh man... up-and-coming bands are totally gonna list you as an influence now! That is SO awesome!")
(tour_hint_new_tour_bwt_complete "Wow.\n\nYou're now known throughout the world as a legend of rock and roll, and you have the badges of honor to prove it. Congratulations on having that rare comination of skill and unbridled insanity!")
